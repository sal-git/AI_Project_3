FILES:
Output files from program and given category files
Program
Readme
Ignorelist (a text file with words to ignore)


I wasn't sure on the table given in the second part of the assignment. Did the instructions request to limit k files, m categories, 
and n words? Config #1, said 10 files, 5 Categories, and 25 words. But do I randomly choose the 10 files and categories? 

I wasn't sure so I printed out the top 200 words from each category/folder and labeled it as training data.
